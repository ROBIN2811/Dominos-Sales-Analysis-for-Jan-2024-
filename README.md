# Dominos-Sales-Analysis
This repository contains SQL scripts, Power BI files, and documentation related to the analysis of Domino's sales for January 2024 as a sample. The analysis involves querying a MySQL database to extract sales data and creating a dashboard using Power BI to visualize key metrics and trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is stored in a MySQL database and contains information about Domino's sales transactions.

I have provided the dataset that I imported in MySQL [Dominos Sales.xlxs]

## Script/Code:
Provided this SQL Scripts:
1. [dominos_table_orders.sql] shows queries for creating order data
2. [dominos_table_order_data.sql] shows queries that later can be either used for creating a dashboard or for customer billing data.

## Methodology
- Data Retrieval: SQL queries are used to extract sales data from the MySQL database.
- Dashboard Creation: Power BI is utilized to create an interactive dashboard to visualize sales metrics and trends.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard showcases key metrics such as total sales, product performance, and geographic distribution of sales.
